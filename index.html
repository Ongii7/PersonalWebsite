            <summary>Lifting</summary>
            <p>Lifting weights is one of my biggest hobbies and originally started to build strength and an aesthetic body. 
               However, over time I realized that it brought me self-discipline it order to actualize my goals. Because of this, 
               lifting is a hobby I still and will continue to take seriously.</p>

            <summary>Creating Projects</summary>
            <p>I believe that working on projects is a necessity in order to build skills as a programmer. Through constant plateaus i've come to realize that just
               reading books and taking online courses are definitely not enough to grow as a programmer. Through consistent practice and applying the things you've learned
               through your hands and making it work, habits and practices will start to flow naturally. Due to this I believe that working on projects plays a significant role
               in my growth as a programmer and remains as a hobby.</p>
